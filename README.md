# Sales Data Analysis - SQL Exploratory Scripts

A comprehensive SQL script collection for exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sales database with dimensional modeling (star schema).

## 📊 Database Schema

This project works with a **gold layer** data warehouse following the star schema pattern:

### Fact Table
- `gold.fact_sales` - Contains transactional sales data

### Dimension Tables
- `gold.dim_customers` - Customer information
- `gold.dim_products` - Product catalog and hierarchy
- `gold.dim_dates` - Date dimensions (implied)

## 🎯 Analysis Categories

### 1. **Schema Exploration**
- Database structure analysis
- Table and column discovery
- Understanding data models

### 2. **Dimension Exploration**
- Unique value identification
- Data categorization and segmentation
- Product hierarchy analysis (Category → Subcategory → Product)

### 3. **Date Range Analysis**
- Temporal boundaries identification
- Data timespan calculation
- Customer age demographics

### 4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- Total Sales Amount
- Total Quantity Sold
- Average Selling Price
- Total Orders
- Total Products
- Total Customers
- Active Customers (who placed orders)

### 5. **Magnitude Analysis**
- Sales by Country
- Customers by Gender
- Products by Category
- Revenue by Category
- Revenue by Customer
- Sales Distribution across Countries

### 6. **Ranking Analysis**
- Top 5 Revenue-Generating Products
- Bottom 5 Performing Products
- Customer ranking by revenue

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQL Server database
- Access to the `gold` schema with appropriate permissions
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio

### Running the Scripts

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-sales-analysis.git
   cd sql-sales-analysis
   ```

2. **Execute scripts in order**
   - Start with `00_full_eda_script.sql` for complete analysis
   - Or run individual scripts from the `scripts/` folder

3. **Customize for your database**
   - Update schema names if different from `gold`
   - Modify table names to match your database structure

## 📈 Key Queries

### Executive Summary Report
Generates a consolidated view of all business KPIs in a single result set:
```sql
SELECT 'Total Sales' AS measure_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS measure_value 
FROM gold.fact_sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Quantity', SUM(quantity) FROM gold.fact_sales
-- ... additional metrics
```

### Top Revenue Products
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 dp.product_name, SUM(fs.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales fs
INNER JOIN gold.dim_products dp ON fs.product_key = dp.product_key
GROUP BY dp.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
```

## 🔍 Analysis Patterns

### Magnitude Analysis Pattern
```
[Aggregation] [Measure] BY [Dimension]
```
Examples:
- Total Sales BY Country
- Total Quantity BY Category
- Average Price BY Product

### Ranking Analysis Pattern
```
Rank [Dimension] BY [Aggregation] [Measure]
```
Examples:
- Rank Countries BY Total Sales
- TOP 5 Products BY Quantity
- Bottom 3 Customers BY Total Orders

## 📝 Notes

- **Distinct Count for Orders**: Always use `COUNT(DISTINCT order_number)` as orders may contain multiple line items
- **Customer Segmentation**: Distinguishes between total customers and customers who have placed orders
- **Date Calculations**: Uses `DATEDIFF` for temporal analysis and age calculations
